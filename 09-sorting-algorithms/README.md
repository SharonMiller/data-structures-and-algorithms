###Sorting Algorithms
Sorting Algorithms with the following functions:


- `insertionSort(array, compare)` takes an array and possibly a sorting function, returns a sorted array
- `mergeSort(array, compare)` takes an array and possibly a sorting function, returns a sorted array
- `selectionSort(array, compare)` takes an array and possibly a sorting function, returns a sorted array
- `quicksort(array, )` takes an array and possibly a sorting function, returns a sorted array
- `radixsort(array, base10)` takes and unordered positive array and a base just as base 10  and will sort the array.
